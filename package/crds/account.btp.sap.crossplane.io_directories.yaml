                      All directories provide the following basic features: (1) Group
                      and filter subaccounts for reports and filters, (2) monitor
                      usage and costs on a directory level (costs only available for
                      contracts that use the consumption-based commercial model),
                      and (3) set custom properties and tags to the directory for
                      identification and reporting purposes.\n-\t<b>ENTITLEMENTS</b>:
                      (Optional) Enables the assignment of a quota for services and
                      applications to the directory from the global account quota
                      for distribution to the subaccounts under this directory.\n-\t<b>AUTHORIZATIONS</b>:
                      (Optional) Allows you to assign users as administrators or viewers
                      of this directory. You must apply this feature in combination
                      with the ENTITLEMENTS feature.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Your multi-level
